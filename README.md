This repo contains the files for my simple MyUnisaModuleInforOrganizer app projecct which is an ionic3,angular5 app
I am adding some files for the first phase of my project,some knowledge of the ionic framework,angular,html and css will help for this project.creating your project with ionic 4 will make bringing it to life much easier with angular.In this first phase are two pages.
1.the landing page modules page displaying the list of modules according to their names.
2.the second page is the page that displays the details of each of those modules fully when any one of them is clicked on the modules page.the data that is displayed is static data from the service page,static for now for learning purposes.more phases to follow till project is complete.
